# Hotel Booking Data Analysis

This repository contains the analysis of hotel booking data aimed at understanding the causes of high cancellation rates, which are negatively affecting the company. The analysis utilizes bar graphs and pie charts to visualize the situation and provides suggested strategies to mitigate the cancellation rates.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used for this analysis contains information about hotel bookings, including booking dates, guest demographics, booking channels, and cancellation status. It provides valuable insights into booking patterns and cancellation behaviors.

## Analysis Process

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

Before analysis, the dataset underwent thorough cleaning and preparation to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This ensured the reliability and accuracy of the analysis results.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to gain initial insights into the data. Key variables such as booking channels, guest demographics, and booking dates were examined to identify potential factors contributing to high cancellation rates.

### Visualization

Bar graphs and pie charts were employed to visually represent the distribution of cancellations across different categories. These visualizations helped in identifying patterns and trends that could explain the high cancellation rates.

## Key Findings

- **Booking Channel Analysis**: Analysis of booking channels revealed that a significant portion of cancellations originated from certain channels.
- **Guest Demographics**: Certain demographics showed higher cancellation rates compared to others, indicating potential preferences or concerns.
- **Booking Patterns**: Analysis of booking dates and patterns uncovered seasonal trends and booking behavior variations that influence cancellation rates.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis findings, the following strategies are suggested to mitigate the high cancellation rates:

- **Targeted Marketing**: Focus marketing efforts on channels that yield lower cancellation rates.
- **Improved Customer Engagement**: Implement strategies to engage customers proactively and address concerns that lead to cancellations.
- **Dynamic Pricing and Policies**: Adjust pricing and cancellation policies to incentivize confirmed bookings while minimizing cancellations.
